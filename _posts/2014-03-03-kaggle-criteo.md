## Summary
This document describes the 4th prize solution to the [Criteo Labs display advertising challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/criteo-display-ad-challenge) hosted by Kaggle.com. The solution consisted of two steps. First the data was preprocessed. Rare and unseen test-set categorical values were all encoded as one category.  The remaining features were one-hot encoded or hashed so that we ended up with roughly 200K separate sparse features. The second step was to use neural networks to train a number of different models with variations coming from different network architectures, bagging and preprocessing parameters. The different models were averaged into one final solution. test

## the rest will be converted later
