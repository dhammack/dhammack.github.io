## Summary
This document describes my part of the 2rd prize solution to the [Data Science Bowl 2017](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2017/) hosted by Kaggle.com. I teamed up with Daniel Hammack. His part of the solution is decribed [here](https://www.google.com/) The goal of the challenge was to predict the development of lung cancer in a patient given a set of CT images. Detailed descriptions of the challenge can be found on the [Kaggle competition page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2017#description) and [this blog post](https://eliasvansteenkiste.github.io/machine%20learning/lung-cancer-pred/) by Elias Vansteenkiste. My solution (and that of Daniel) was mainly based on nodule detectors with a 3D convolutional neural network architecture.


## Initial familiarization and the resulting "plan of attack"
Before joining the competition I first watched the [video by Bram van Ginneken on lung CT images](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XUKq3B4sdw) to get a feel for the problem. I tried to manually asses a few scans and concluded that this was a hard problem where you almost literally had to find a needle in a haystack. Like described by [Elias Vansteenkiste](https://eliasvansteenkiste.github.io/machine%20learning/lung-cancer-pred/) the amount of signal vs noise was almost 1:1000.000. As the first efforts on the formums showed, the neural nets were not able to learn someting from the raw image data. There were only 1300 cases to train on and the label "Cancer Y/N" was to distant from the actual features in the images for the network to latch upon. 

The solution would be to spoonfeed a neural network with examples with a better signal/noise ratio and a more direct relation between the labels and the features. Luckily the competition organizers already pointed us to a previous competition called [LUNA16](https://luna16.grand-challenge.org/). For this dataset doctors had meticulously labeled more than 1000 lung nodules in more than 800 patient scans. The LUNA16 competition also provided non-nodule annotations. So when you crop small 3D chunks around the annotations from the big CT scans you end up with much smaller 3D images with a more direct labels (nodule Y/N). The dataset also contained size information. As the size usually is a good predictor of being a cancer so I thought this would be a useful starting point.

![The plan](/images/plan2017_2.png)
*Figure 1. High level description of the approach*

Later I noticed that the LUNA16 dataset was drawn from another public dataset [LIDC-IDRI](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/LIDC-IDRI). It turned out that in this original set the nodules had not only been detected by the doctors but they also gave an assessment on the malignancy and other properties of the nodules. This malignancy assessment turned out to be learnable by the neural network and a "golden" feature for estimating the cancer risk.

The final plan of attack was to train a neural network to detect nodules and predict the malignancy of the detected nodules. During prediction every patient scan would be processed by the network going over it in a sliding window fashion. This resulted in a lattice containing malignancy information for every location that the sliding window had visited. The final step was to predict the chance that that the patient would develop a cancer given this information and some other features.


## Preprocessing and creating a trainset
The preprocessing of the CT scans was the first step. It was important to make the scans as homogenous as possible. To do this, first every scan was rescaled so that every voxel represented an areas of 1x1x1 mm. Both Daniel and me did some experiments with other scales but 1mm was a good balance between accuracy and computational load. With CT scans the pixel intensities can be expressed in [Hounsfield Units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hounsfield_scale) and have semantic meaning. As suggested on the forums all intensities were clipped on the min, max interesting hounsfield value and then scaled between 0 and 1. The last importand CT preprocessing step was to make sure that all scans had the same orientation. 

Almost all the literature on nodule detection and almost all tutorials on the forums advised to first segment out the lung tissue from the CT-scans. However, none of the segmentation approaches were good enough to adequately handle nodules and masses that were hidden near the edges of the lung tissue. Sometimes these were removed from the images leaving no chance for the nodule detector to find. I first considered training a U-net to properly segment the lungs. This would almost surely give better results than traditional segmentation techniques. However, when I visually inspected CT scans, the borders of the lung tissue gave me a good frame of reference to find nodules. It was my hunch that the convnet might also "like" this information. So in the end I concluded that segmenting the lungs was a pre-convnet relic from the past and decided to train and predict on raw images.

In more straight forward competition the traindata is a given and is not interesting to discuss. However, for this solution engineering trainset was an essential, if not the most essential part. I used provided labels, generated automatic labels, employed automatic active learning and also added some manual annotations. Below is a table with the different sources I used as labels.


![Labelsets](/images/table_labels.png)
*Figure 1. Labelsets used for training.*

The quantity of positive doctor labels from LIDC is five times the number of the LUNA16 set. The reason is that these are the combined annotations of 4 doctors. So one nodule can be annotated 4 times. LUNA16 also ignored nodules that were only annotated by less than 3 doctors. I decided to keep these in because of the valuable malignancy information that was provided with these labels. The candidates(v2) set were taken straight from LUNA16. These were false positive candidate nodules taken from a wide range nodule detection systems. Note that some of these candidates overlapped nodules that were tagged by less than 3 doctors. I kept them in to provide some counter balance. To train on the full images I needed negative candidates from non-lung tissue. I used a simple lung segmentation algorithm from the forums and samples annotations around the edges of the segmentation masks. After doing a first training round I predicted nodules on the LUNA16 datasets. All false positives were harvested and added to the trainset. After I finished building my model I wanted to build another model. For my second model I played radiologist and let the network predict on the NDSB trainset. Then I manually tried to select interesting positive nodules from cancer cases and false positives from non-cancer cases. Then I trained a second model with these extra labels. I expected better results but it turned out that I am a bad radiologist since the second model with my manual labels was worse then the model without. However, the blend of the two models was better than the seperate models so I kept the second model in. I used a special, hastily built, viewer to debug all the labels. While viewing I noticed that some >3cm big nodules were ignored by the doctors. Reading the LIDC documentation I found that the doctors were ordered to ignore >3m labels. Fearing that my classifier would be confused by these ignored masses I removed negatives that overlapped with them.

Below are some screenshot I took.

## Hand labeling
The traindata of the competition only contained the final determined volumes of the left ventricle. There was no information on how this volume was obtained. There was the possibility of using the [Sunnybrook](http://www.cardiacatlas.org/studies/sunnybrook-cardiac-data/) dataset but the cases in that set were much more simple than the cases I encountered in the DICOM files. Of course I was thinking of using a convolutional neural network (CNN) for the image segmentation. CNN's are great but they need a lot of traindata. Luckily I already had an overlay-drawing tool that I once built for an earlier project. I decided to label 100 patients with this tool. For every patient I took frame 1 (usually diastole) and frame 12 (usually systole). 

Since every patient had around 10 slices that meant that I had to label around 2000 images. Once I got the hang of it using my tool I was able to label around 1 patient per minute. During the labeling I encountered many confusing cases that I still don't know how to label. I scanned youtube and many papers but there were no definate answers on the internet. In the end I decided to at least be consistent. If I would be consistent then in a later stage I could brush out systematic errors during the calibration phase. Below are a number of situations that were encountered.

After I trained a segmenter on the 100 patients and made a first submission (#3 at that time while the competition was already 2 months underway) my confidence in my approach grew. That motivated me to improve my segmenter and label more images. Most people call this boring work but I actually enjoyed the labeling. Even if you are out of ideas you still have the feeling that you are making progress. Also many high-payed overworked cardiac experts must devote a large portion of their time to this work. I figured that if I did my work right my effort would be neglectable to the effort that could be spared with the final solution. I did however notice more and more diminishing returns for every new batch I labeled.

Like other competitors I started to notice the outlier patients that were the biggest barrier to get a higher score. At first I wanted to apply [active learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_learning_(machine_learning)) to boost hard examples by taking images from other frames than 1 and 12. However, with all the discussion on the forums about wat was and was not allowed I was afraid that people might think that I was actively targetting the test-set with the extra examples so I dropped this idea. I think an improvement is possible by boosting hard examples.

## Image segmentation with the U-net architecture (built in MxNet)
When you search the literature on image segmentation with CNN's there is no clear "winner" architecture. There were the reasonably successful [sliding widow approaches](http://people.idsia.ch/~ciresan/data/ISBI2012.pdf). However, from first hand experience I knew they were a bit cumbersome to use and they get coarser when you get deeper. The benchmark example provided by Mike Kim used a [fully convolutional neural net](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jonlong/long_shelhamer_fcn.pdf). These are easier to use but they also give a rather coarse resolution when you go deep. There are some papers about using [conditional random fields or recurrent nets](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~szheng/papers/CRFasRNN.pdf) as post processing to improve the detail. However, both approached did not really appeal to me due to the added complexity. [Here](https://github.com/kjw0612/awesome-deep-vision#semantic-segmentation) is an exhaustive list of various approaches.

It was a lucky accident that I stumbled upon the paper on the [u-net architecture](http://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net/). This architecture allowed for more detail in the segmentation by using shortcut connections from the i'th layer to the n-i'th layer. They presented a number of impressive results and as far as I could see the person that came up with the architecture now works for Google Deepmind. To me that proved that appearantly he was on to something.  Below is a schematic overview.

![U-net](/images/unet.png)
*Figure 4. U-net architecture*

The paper was very clear and readable and I had a prototype running in [mxnet](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet) without much effort. As someone that deploys deep learning systems to various targets (embedded, windows, linux, cloud etc) in various programming languages I really recommend this library. 

After getting an example running I started to experiment with different parameters and settings. Below a few key observations and improvements are enumerated. 

1. Segmentation nets are numerically unstable. I relied heavily on batch normalization.
2. Smaller batch sizes yielded better scores and stability. I settled for batchsize = 2.
3. Elastic deformations were by far the most effective augmentations
4. The shortcut connection gave a significant improvement in accuracy. 
5. Logistic regression was better loss than RMSE but even better alternatives quite possibly exist.
6. Dropout helped but it was hard to determine where to apply it. I choose upstream after the shortcut merges.
7. Adding more layers quickly led to diminishing returns
8. Adding more filters per layer quicky showed no improvement
9. It was hard, if not impossible to overfit the network.
10. Training time was around 5 hours

After a lot of trial and error I ended up with the following network.
Note that I used relu activations and batch normalization after every convolution. 
I used padding for the convolutional layers to not let them decrease output shape.
Below the architecture is displayed. Note that my approach is very much trial and error and many decisions don't have a grounded theory.

![Segmenter network](/images/segmenter_net.png)
*Figure 5. Network definition used for this solution*

The segmentation results were quite impressive. The "easy cases" where virtually perfect. Cases where the LV tissue was only half around were nicely filled up with a "half moon"-like overlay. There were some cases where the net was confused but this was almost always due to strange outliers of which it never had seen any examples before.
Patients with many heavily contracted LV's seemed to be a little underestimated by the system. This is probably because I should have labeled contracted LV's more generous. Below, a few cases are shown.

## Integrating the predictions into volumes and data cleaning.
Theoretically, once you have the LV areas per slice, the step to compute the volumes is straight forward. You take the slice areas and multiply by their thickness and then sum. You can even be more fancy and compute the volumes using frustum of a cone approximations like in the tutorials. I did that but it only gave a small improvement.
It was much more beneficial to put extra effort in the data cleaning process. Taking MRI's is obviously a very error prone process and many computations went wrong because of irregularities in the data. Below some common problems are discussed.

1. *Patients with virtually no slices.*<br>
   Patient 595 and 599 only had 3 slices. I decided to drop them and predict their volumes later on based on averages for age and sex.
2. *No real guide for slice thickness.*<br>
  I eventually used the difference between slice locations to determine the slice thickness. Although the slice location was not 100% perfect other calculations based on image orientation and location also had their problems so I settled for the simplest option.
3. *Slice ordering.*<br>
  Usually the MRI makes slices from the base downto the apex. But sometimes the machines seemed to get stuck or went back up again. This would result in negative slice thicknesses. The fix was to order the slices based on location and not in time.
4. *Out of range slices.*<br>
  After ordering the slices I sometimes noticed thicknesses of 100+ mm. Since the expected thickness was around 10mm I concluded that these slices were out of range (stomach, neck) so I dropped them.
5. *Missing slices.*<br>
  After putting in a maximum slice thickness there turned out to be some sliced that were 20 or even more mm but they were valid. My conclusion was that in these cases other slices in the sequence were missing.
  My measure against this was to allow for these big slices as long as they fell between the base and the apex.
6. *Wrongly oriented slices.*<br>
  In a very few occasions slices would suddenly be rotated. Luckily my segmenter did not suffer from this so there was no need to take measures against this.
7. *Frames not present on all slices.*<br>
  Sometimes certain frames where not present in all slices. This could lead to errors in comparing the total volumes between frames. Therefore I introduced a requirement that a frame had to be present in every slice or else it would be dropped.
 
Another important point to note is that two volumes need to be determined at the same time. Namely systole (contracted) and diastole (expanded).
I tried two approaches for determining which frames where systole and diastole. The first was to take the frame with total volume maximum volume as diastole and the one with the minimum volume as systole. The second method was to find the image with the larges area and use that frame as diastole. Then within that series look for the smallest area and use that frame as systole.
The second approach is probably what doctors do but somehow the first approach was more stable and worked better with the calibration step that followed. My guess the reason is that the first approach is more consistent. It structurally a bit too low for systole and a bit too high for diastole. This signal 
can easily be picked up by the gradient boosting procedure that I used for calibrating the volumes.

## Calibration
From the labels to the segmenter to the volume computation there were plenty of opportunities to introduce systematic errors. The traindata for the competition provided the "real" volumes as determined by the cardiac specialists. It would be wasteful to not use this data to improve the estimations.
During a "calibration" step I tried to detect and mitigate systematic error by using a gradient boosting regressor with the raw estimations and some extra features. I tried a lot of features that had great potential for predicting the error. Examples are the amount of "unsureness" of my segmenter expressed in low probability pixels,
the biggest slice, the number of dropped slices etc. However it turned out that the regular features provided in the dicom files were the most benefitial. Next to the raw predictions other helpful features were age, sex, angle, slice-thickness and slice-count.

There were a number of targets that could be regressed on. The volume, the real/estimated ratio and the error (residual). The last one gave the best improvements. The gradient boosting regressor tried to predict the error in the estimation given all the features.
With the prediction of that error I could adjust my estimation and this led to a better overall estimation. To avoid the risk of overfitting it was necessary to train the segmenter in folds. For more information about two level models [this](http://mlwave.com/kaggle-ensembling-guide/) is a nice guide.
Training different folds slowed everything down quite a bit but in the end I think it was well worth the effort. Below is a table of the improvements in mean absolute errors.

![MAE](/images/mae.png)
*Figure 7. Mean absolute error before and after calibration*

As can be seen the MAE improved by 1 ml which was quite a bit. On the leaderboard the calibration step provided a boost in the score of around 0.0005 which is almost the difference between #3 and #4.

## Submission
Kaggle came up with an evaluation function which I came to like very much. This was the [Continuous Rank Probability Score](http://www.eumetcal.org/resources/ukmeteocal/verification/www/english/msg/ver_prob_forec/uos3b/uos3b_ko1.htm). Next to an accurate prediction you also had to tell how sure you were of your prediction.
I tried a few strategies but the one that worked best for me was the following. For a prection I determined the standard deviation in the errors for other prediction with similar volumes. Then I plugged the estimated volume and the standard deviation in a [cumulative density function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function).
The resulting values were used for my submission. This was a simple and stable procedure that was aware of errors/variance in the ground thruth and in the estimations. The ideal batch size for determining the standard deviation was between 30 and 60.

## Some conclusions and remarks
First of all I'm very happy with the resulting model. It is simple and straightforward and there are a number of possible improvements if one were to use this model in a real-life scenario.
Below are a number of possible improvements.

1. *Hand-labeling by a real expert.*<br>
I am sure that I labeled some of the cases completely wrong. Labels provided by experts would most likely drastically improve the performance.
2. *Active learning (boost hard examples).*<br>
I was afraid to boost the train images of cases where the segmenter had a hard time. People might accuse me of cheating. However [active learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_learning_(machine_learning)) is a perfectly valid aproach for improving the performance of a system like this.
3. *Cleaner data.*<br>
The outliers in this dataset were very important in this competition. A small number of patients were responsible for the biggest loss in performance. Of course I investigated them thouroughly. However, in many cases I could not find a problem in my estimated volumes. My conclusion was that the provided volumes were plain wrong.
The biggest outlier was [patient 429](https://www.kaggle.com/c/second-annual-data-science-bowl/forums/t/18372/some-cases-are-quite-off-from-the-true-value/104711). This patient alone was responsible for a 89ml error. Until now there is still no explanation for this strange value.
Cases like this confused the calibration step and increased the standard deviation during the submission so they had a big impact on the final score.

Before the competition the doctors told during a Q&A session that errors 10ml would be acceptable. On average we are below this value. Of course there is the problem of the outliers but I am very confident that these issues can be resoved. Therefore I would like to call this problem:

## Thanks	
1. *Kaggle and Booz Allen Hamilton.*<br> Thank you for organizing this complex and cool challenge. There were some complaints about the whole two phase setup and the quality of the data. But if we want to take on more ambitious problems than the usual CTR/forecasting stuff you sometimes need to try something new an take some risk.

2. *Mxnet.*<br> What can I say... great library when you also want to deploy your systems in real-world situations. Especially good windows support is something that is severely lacking from most other libraries.

3. *The authors of the U-net paper.* <br> The idea was great. The paper was easy to understand with clear language and concrete examples. That is something you do not find everyday in the deep learning community.
