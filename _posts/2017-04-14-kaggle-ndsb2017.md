## Summary
This document describes my part of the 2rd prize solution to the [Data Science Bowl 2017](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2017/) hosted by Kaggle.com. I teamed up with Daniel Hammack. His part of the solution is decribed [here](https://www.google.com/) The goal of the challenge was to predict the development of lung cancer in a patient given a set of MRI images. Detailed descriptions of the challenge can be found on the [Kaggle competition page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2017#description) and [this blog post](https://eliasvansteenkiste.github.io/machine%20learning/lung-cancer-pred/) by Elias Vansteenkiste. My solution (and that of Daniel) relied on nodule detector with a 3D convolutional neural network architecture.
