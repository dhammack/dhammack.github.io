## Summary
This document describes the 3rd prize solution to the [Second National Data Science Bowl](https://www.kaggle.com/c/second-annual-data-science-bowl) hosted by Kaggle.com. The goal of the competition was to perform automatic volume measurement of the left ventricle based on MRI images. My solution relied heavily on image segmentation with a neural network architecture called "U-nets".
